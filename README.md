# View_communication
> This is code for paper  ‘ Multi-view Learning Inspired by Human Communication Model ’
> We have published a reproducible demo and two datasets here.

## 1. Code Ocean Version
> You can also find this demo on Code Ocean and easily run it by clicking the 'Reproducible Run' button.
> https://codeocean.com/capsule/4589629/tree/v2

## 2. How to run
> Run 'bcpp/view_communication.py' on human breast cancer prognosis prediction dataset.
> 
> Run 'Mnist/communication_with_fusion.py' on Noisy Mnist dataset.

## 3. Data Availablity
> Human Breast Cancer Prognosis Prediction data： original data in 'BCPP/data/', train and test data in 'data_set/bcpp/'
> 
> Noisy Mnist data: original data can be download from 'https://ttic.uchicago.edu/~wwang5/dccae.html'， 
> and then you have to put it into 'Mnist/data/' if you want to run this demo, train and test data will be write to 'data_set/Mnist' when you run.
