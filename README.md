# View_communication
> This is code for paper  ‘ Human Collective Intelligence inspired Multi-view Representation Learning: Enabling View Communication by Simulating Human Communication Mechanism ’
> We have published a reproducible demo and two datasets here.

## 1. How to run
> Run 'bcpp/view_communication.py' on human breast cancer prognosis prediction dataset.
> 
> Run 'Mnist/communication_with_fusion.py' on Noisy Mnist dataset.

## 2. Data Availablity
> Human Breast Cancer Prognosis Prediction data： original data in 'BCPP/data/', train and test data in 'data_set/bcpp/'
> 
> Noisy data: original data can be download from 'https://ttic.uchicago.edu/~wwang5/dccae.html'， 
> and then you have to put it into 'Mnist/data/' if you want to run this demo, train and test data will be write to 'data_set/Mnist' when you run.

## 3. Requirements
> pandas==0.24.2 
> 
> sklearn==0.0 
> 
> torch==1.0.0 
> 
> torchvision==0.4.0
> 
> numpy==1.14.0
